The elevator cars will move to pick up passengers and disembark them. The algorithm is simple and naive, but in general, an &quot;up&quot; elevator should keep going up until it has no more passengers and the same for a &quot;down&quot; elevator - an elevator doesn&#39;t yo-yo up and down between floors while still containing passengers. There is an optimized algorithm in that could pick up requests along the direction of the elevators movement. The program also indicates the relative position of the elevator cars (car 1 is on floor 3, car 2 is on floor 10) and user actions (&quot;down&quot; request on floor 4 received, &quot;up&quot; request on floor 7 received); a simple console logging can be seen in the simulation section. </p><p data-v-63229d38> This is a simple programming exercise.
